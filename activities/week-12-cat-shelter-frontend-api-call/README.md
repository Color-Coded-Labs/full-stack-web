# CRUD Front End Implementation Activity:

## Read (do this one first!):
* when I click "get all cats" I want the cats to be fetched and then displayed on the dom.

## Create:
* when I enter cat name and age, I want that cat added to the "database", and then the updated cats list displayed on the DOM
## Update:
* when I enter a cat ID, name, and age, and then click "update cat" I want the put endpoint on the API to be called and the updated cats list displayed on the page
## Delete:
* when I enter a cat ID in the delete field, I want that cat to be deleted (adopted) when I click the "adopt cat" button. The cats list on the page should be updated to reflect the removed cat.
