#### Learning Goals
By the end of this week, you should be able to:
- [ ] Design and implement RESTful APIs using Express.
- [ ] Perform CRUD operations, manipulating data effectively in an Express app.
- [ ] Utilize local storage for temporary data persistence in your Express application.
- [ ] Apply basic error handling techniques in Express to manage and respond to various error scenarios.

#### Homework Assignment: Personalized CRUD Express API

##### Objective
Develop a personalized RESTful API using Express, performing CRUD operations on a data model that reflects a personal interest or hobby.

##### Step-by-Step Guide
1. **Choose Your Theme**: Select a theme for your API, related to a hobby, interest, or personal project (e.g., a recipe collection, a personal book library, a portfolio of artworks).
2. **Setup and Installations**:
   - Initialize a new Node.js project if you haven’t already (`npm init`).
   - Install Express (`npm install express`) and any other necessary packages.
3. **Creating CRUD Routes**:
   - Set up an Express server in a file (e.g., `app.js` or `server.js`).
   - Implement routes for CRUD operations (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) that interact with a simple data structure or local storage.
4. **Implementing Local Storage**:
   - Store and retrieve your data using local storage or a simple JavaScript object.
5. **Error Handling in Routes**:
   - Add error handling to your routes to manage exceptions and provide meaningful responses.
6. **Testing Your API**:
   - Test the functionality of your API with tools like Postman or by creating a simple front-end interface.

##### Deliverables
Submit the following:
- The project folder containing your server file (`app.js` or `server.js`) and any other relevant files.
- A document detailing your API's theme, the structure of your CRUD operations, and how you've implemented error handling and local storage.

#### Glossary of Key Terms
- **RESTful API**: An API that adheres to the principles of REST, allowing for stateless client-server communication.
- **CRUD Operations**: Operations that represent Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities in database interaction.
- **Local Storage**: A way to store data locally on a user’s browser or within the server environment in Node.js applications.
- **Error Handling**: The method of catching and managing errors in a software application to prevent crashes and provide user-friendly error messages.
