- State Management in React with Hooks
- Understanding and Using the useEffect Hook in React
- Building Interactive User Interfaces with React

#### Learning Goals
By the end of this module, students should be able to:
- [ ] Grasp the core concepts of React, including components, JSX, and state management.
- [ ] Utilize React hooks such as useState and useEffect for managing state and side effects in functional components.

#### Homework Assignment: Building a React Application

##### Objective
Create a dynamic web application using React. The application should have multiple interactive components, state management, and incorporate side effects.

##### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Application Design**:
   - Choose a theme or idea for your application (e.g., a to-do list, blog, weather app).
   - Sketch out the layout and identify the components needed.

2. **Setting Up the Environment**:
   - Initialize a new React project using Create React App.
   - Organize your project structure with components, utilities, and assets.

3. **Developing Components**:
   - Build your individual React components.
   - Ensure proper use of state and props for data handling.

4. **Implementing State and Effects**:
   - Use the `useState` hook for state management in your components.
   - Incorporate the `useEffect` hook for any side effects such as data fetching, subscriptions, or timers.

5. **UI and Interactivity**:
   - Style your components using CSS or a styling library.
   - Implement user interaction and event handling.

6. **Testing and Refinement**:
   - Test your application for bugs and performance issues.
   - Refine and optimize your code and UI.

##### Deliverables
Submit a link to your GitHub repository containing:
- The complete React project code.
- A README file detailing the project, how to run it, and any other necessary documentation.

#### Glossary of Key Terms
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.
- **JSX**: A syntax extension for JavaScript used in React to describe the UI that looks similar to HTML.
- **State**: An object that determines the behavior and rendering of a React component, changeable over time.
- **useEffect**: A hook in React for performing side effects in functional components.
- **Functional Component**: A simpler way to write components as functions in React, which can use state and other React features via hooks.
- **Hook**: Special functions in React that let you "hook into" React features, like state and lifecycle methods, in functional components.
- **Component Lifecycle**: The series of methods that are invoked in different stages of a component's existence in React.
- **Side Effect**: Operations in a React component that affect other components or cannot be done during rendering, such as data fetching or subscribing to events.
- **useState**: A hook in React that lets you add state to functional components.
- **Declarative Programming**: A programming paradigm that expresses the logic of computation without describing its control flow, often used in building UIs in React.
- **Props**: Short for properties, these are read-only components that must be kept pure, used to pass data from parent to child components in React.
