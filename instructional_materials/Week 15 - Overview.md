- Building a login component in React, managing form state and validations.
- Navigating React applications with React Router.

### Learning Goals
By the end of this week, you should be able to:

- [ ] Understand and use `useState` for managing component state.
- [ ] Utilize `useEffect` for side effects in components.
- [ ] Create a functional login component with form handling.
- [ ] Implement routing in your React application using React Router.

### Homework Assignment: Creating a Login Form and Implementing Navigation with React Router

#### Objective
Build a React application with a login form component and implement client-side navigation using React Router.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **React Project Setup**:
   - If starting a new project, create a new React application using `npx create-react-app`.
   - Set up your project structure with components and routing folders.

2. **Creating a Login Component**:
   - Design your login form with input fields for username and password.
   - Manage form state using `useState` and add form validation.

3. **Implementing Routing**:
   - Install and set up React Router in your project.
   - Create multiple routes and link between them using React Router.

4. **Integrating `useEffect`**:
   - Use `useEffect` for handling side effects like fetching data or listening to events within your components.

5. **Testing Your Application**:
   - Ensure the login component works correctly with validations.
   - Test the navigation between different routes in your application.

#### Deliverables
Submit the following:
- Your React project folder containing all the components and routing setup.
