## Introduction
Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript outside the traditional web browser environment, enabling server-side scripting and the creation of scalable network applications.

### History of Node.js
Node.js was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009, with the goal of achieving non-blocking, event-driven servers, to make web applications more scalable. It has since become a cornerstone in modern web development.

## Installation Guide
